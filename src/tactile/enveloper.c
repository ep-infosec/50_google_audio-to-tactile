   *
   * After half-wave rectification, roughly half of the signal is zero, and the
   * other half are semiperiodic pulses. The signal is then squared and lowpass
   * filtered with cutoff `energy_cutoff_hz`. For the baseband channel, the
   * pulse rate is well below the cutoff and the pulse peak height is mostly
   * maintained. But for higher channels, the pulse rate is above the cutoff and
   * pulse peak height is substantially reduced. PCEN's AGC amplifies these
   * differences because (by design) the AGC emphasizes signal onsets.
   *
   * To compensate for this effect, we compute and use an `equalization`
   * factor for each channel as follows:
   *
   * 1. Suppose the input is a unit-amplitude sinusoid with frequency at the
   *    geometric midpoint of the channel band. ComputeFilteredPeak() computes
   *    the peak signal height after half-wave rectification, squaring, and
   *    lowpass filtering. This value is stored in `state_c->peak`.
   *
   * 2. In the loop below, `pcen_peak` computes the signal peak value after
   *    PCEN. The `energy_tau_s` parameter is assumed to be large enough that
   *    the denominator has smoothed to the signal average, which is 1/4. We
   *    compute `equalization` such that scaling the denominator by this factor
   *    would make PCEN's output approximately equal to kTargetOutput.
   *
   * 3. In EnveloperProcessSamples(), we scale the `smoothed_energy` signal by
   *    `equalization`.
