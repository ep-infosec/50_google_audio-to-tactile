 *
 * A library to synthesize a few simple tactile patterns. These patterns are the
 * haptic equivalent of sound effects, useful as feedback in UI. The patterns
 * are multichannel sequences of sine waves, chirps, and pauses.
 *
 * The synthesizer takes a byte string as input, encoding the pattern to play.
 * Taking inspiration from music tracker formats, like Amiga MOD
 * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOD_(file_format), the byte string is a
 * sequence of basic ops (e.g., set a channel's waveform). These ops have a
 * compact representation and are simple to implement, yet can be composed in
 * many ways to produce a variety of patterns. Additionally, it is possible to
 * add new features to this format by defining new ops and waveforms.
 *
 * To avoid potential artifacts, the synthesizer takes care to smoothly fade
 * waveforms in and out as needed. Fading is done over a 20 ms interval using a
 * Hann window.
 *
 * Example, playing a simple format pattern:
 *   const char* simple_pattern = "555-C-8";
 *   TactilePattern p;
 *   TactilePatternInit(&p, kSampleRateHz, kNumChannels);
 *   TactilePatternStart(&p, simple_pattern);
 *
 *   float samples[kNumFrames * kNumChannels];
 *   while (TactilePatternSynthesize(&p, kNumFrames, samples)) {
 *     // ...
 *   }
 *
 * Example, playing an extended format pattern:
 *   const uint8_t ex_pattern[] = {
 *     kTactilePatternOpSetWaveform + 0, kTactilePatternWaveformSin25Hz,
 *     kTactilePatternOpSetGain + 1, 0xff, // Gain 1.0.
 *     TACTILE_PATTERN_OP_PLAY_MS(100),       // Play for 100 ms.
 *     kTactilePatternOpMove, 0x01,        // Move from channel 0 to 1.
 *     TACTILE_PATTERN_OP_PLAY_MS(100),       // Play for 100 ms.
 *     kTactilePatternOpMove, 0x12,        // Move from channel 1 to 2.
 *     TACTILE_PATTERN_OP_PLAY_MS(100),       // Play for 100 ms.
 *     kTactilePatternOpEnd,
 *   };
 *   TactilePattern p;
 *   TactilePatternInit(&p, kSampleRateHz, kNumChannels);
 *   TactilePatternStartEx(&p, ex_pattern);
 *
 *   float samples[kNumFrames * kNumChannels];
 *   while (TactilePatternSynthesize(&p, kNumFrames, samples)) {
 *     // ...
 *   }
