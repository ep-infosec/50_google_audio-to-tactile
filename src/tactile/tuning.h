 * Functions for tuning TactileProcessor's noise robustness vs. sensitivity.
 *
 * The idea is the tuning functions below may be called in response to button
 * presses on the puck or BLE web app to adjust noise robustness vs. sensitivity
 * while it is running. To simplify the calling code, each parameter is
 * represented with an integer control value between 0 and 255, which is then
 * mapped in a way that makes sense for that parameter.
 *
 * Example use:
 *   TuningKnobs tuning_knobs = kDefaultTuningKnobs;
 *   // Make changes to the knobs...
 *   tuning_knobs.values[kKnobOutputGain] = 100;
 *   // Apply the new settings.
 *   TactileProcessorApplyTuning(tactile_processor, &tuning_knobs);
