 * Tactor energy envelope, a simple audio-to-tactile representation.
 *
 * This library computes energy envelopes over 4 bandpass channels of an input
 * mono audio stream:
 *
 *   Channel 0: Baseband channel with 80-500 Hz sensitivity to capture low pitch
 *              harmonics, percussion, drums.
 *
 *   Channel 1: Vowel channel, bandpassed to 500-3500 Hz to get speech formants,
 *              followed by an envelope with 500 Hz cutoff to get pitch rate.
 *
 *   Channel 2: Sh fricative channel, bandpassed to 2500-3500 Hz to pick out
 *              postalveolar sounds like "sh" vs. other fricatives.
 *
 *   Channel 3: Fricative channel, bandpassed to 4000-6000 Hz followed by
 *              an envelope, to capture frication noise.
 *
 * For compression and onset emphasis, we apply a modified version of PCEN
 * [per-channel energy normalization, go/pcen] to each channel.
 *
 * For each channel, audio is processed this way:
 *
 *   1. Bandpass energy computation.
 *     a. A bandpass filter is applied, implemented as two biquads.
 *     b. The signal is half-wave rectified and squared to obtain energy.
 *     c. A second order lowpass filter is applied to the energy.
 *     d. The lowpassed energy is decimated.
 *
 *   2. Soft noise gating. We want to normalize speech and salient sounds toward
 *      0 dB, yet we don't want to amplify noise. Our assumption is that the
 *      noise envelope changes slowly and that salient sounds are bursty and
 *      louder than the noise.
 *
 *     a. A smoothed energy is computed using a one-pole smoother.
 *
 *     b. The noise energy is estimated by smoothing the smoothed energy in log
 *        space. Filtering in log space puts more weight on small values and is
 *        less influenced by short bursts of energy in the signal.
 *
 *     c. The noise gate soft threshold is set at `denoising_strength * noise`
 *        and with a transition width of `denoising_transition_db` dB.
 *
 *   3. The gated AGC gain `soft_gate_weight * smoothed_energy^-agc_strength` is
 *      computed and smoothed with a one-pole lowpass filter, then applied to
 *      the energy. This denoises and partially normalizes the energy.
 *
 *   4. The normalized energy is compressed with a power law as
 *      `(agc_output + delta)^exponent - delta^exponent`.
 *
 *   5. Final output is multiplied by a constant output gain factor.
 *
 * Example use:
 *   // Initialize a vowel energy envelope.
 *   Enveloper enveloper;
 *   EnveloperInit(&enveloper, &kDefaultEnveloperParams,
 *                 input_sample_rate_hz, decimation_factor);
 *
 *   // Processing loop.
 *   const int kNumSamples = 64;
 *   const int kOutputFrames = kNumSamples / decimation_factor;
 *   while (...) {
 *     float input[kNumSamples] = ...
 *     float output[kOutputFrames * kEnveloperNumChannels];
 *     EnveloperProcessSamples(&state, input, kNumSamples, output);
 *     ...
 *   }
