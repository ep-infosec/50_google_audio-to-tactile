 * Filter to partially equalize the tactor's perceptual response.
 *
 * Vibrotactile perception has usable sensitivity for tactile interfaces in the
 * range 50-400Hz. It is about 20 dB more sensitive at 200 Hz, that is, the
 * perceived strength of a 50 Hz signal is similar to a 200 Hz signal that is 20
 * dB quieter.
 *
 * This library designs a filter to take this perceptual effect into account, to
 * partially equalize the response vs. frequency.

 *  - frequencies below 10 Hz are attenuated,
 *  - roughly unit gain around 20-110 Hz,
 *  - gain of roughly `mid_gain` (as a linear amplitude) in 110-450 Hz,
 *  - gain of roughly `high_gain` (linear amplitude) above 450 Hz.
