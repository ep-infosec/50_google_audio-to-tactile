 * Fast log2, exp2, pow, and tanh functions in C.
 *
 * This library implements fast log2 (log base 2), exp2 (2^x), power x^y, and
 * tanh functions for 32-bit float arguments through float bit manipulations and
 * small lookup tables.
 *
 * NOTE: This library assumes `float` uses 32-bit IEEE 754 floating point
 * representation. Most current machines do, but not all.
 *
 * You can use rules of logs and exponents to compute related functions:
 *  - Natural log: log(x) = FastLog2(x) * M_LN2.
 *  - Log base 10: log10(x) = FastLog2(x) / log2(10).
 *  - Log base b: log_b(x) = FastLog2(x) / log2(b).
 *  - Exponential: e^x = FastExp2(x / M_LN2).
 *  - Power of 10: 10^x = FastExp2(log2(10) * x).
 *  - Power of constant b: b^x = FastExp2(log2(b) * x).
 *  - Square root: sqrt(x) = FastPow(x, 0.5f)
 *    [Note: on modern x86 processors, `sqrtf()` from math.h is comparably fast,
 *    but more accurate, compiling to a `sqrtss` SSE instruction.]
 *
 * Accuracy:
 *  - FastLog2(x) has max absolute error of about 0.003.
 *  - FastExp2(x) has max relative error of about 0.3%.
 *  - FastPow(x) has max relative error of about 0.5%.
 *  - FastTanh(x) has max absolute error of about 0.0008.
 *
 * Benchmarks (measured by extras/benchmark/fast_fun_benchmark.cpp):
 * These functions take an order of magnitude less time than those in math.h.
 * Benchmark timings of calling each function 1000 times on an Intel Skylake
 * Xeon (3696 MHz CPUs). To get the time for an individual call, divide
 * times in the table by 1000, e.g. one FastLog2 call costs 0.757 ns.
