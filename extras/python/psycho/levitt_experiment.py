    This class takes in true/false decisions by the user and changes the
    level for the next experiment.  After creating the class with the
    appropriate parameters, call note_response() with each new user action.
    This method notes the response, and changes the level based on the
    internal response_rule() method.  The new level is returned for use in
    the next trial.

        add/subtracted from the current level. When multiplicative_step is

        monotonic change in the level).  As Levitt suggests, the current
        step is the initial_step divided by the number of runs so far.
